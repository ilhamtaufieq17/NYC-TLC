# About
LibApp application was released in 2024 and developed by myself. Helping business people especially those engaged in the library is our motivation for developing this application. LibApp makes it easy to recapitulate inventory . LibApp offers four excellent features including:

1. **Read Book**, LibApp displays the entire stock of items available in the database, and you will always get the latest updates from your database.
2. **Add Book**, LibApp helps you register new items such as title, author, category or quantity.
3. **Update Book**, LibApp helps you update existing items, such as title, author, category or quantity.
4. **Delete Book**, LibApp provides high mobility to remove items that you do not need.
