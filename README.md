# Overview
This project analyzes trip data to identify patterns and anomalies in taxi services within New York City. It aims to provide insights into driver behaviors, payment methods, and fare structures. The analysis focuses on key areas such as trip distances, payment preferences, and the effects of various surcharges.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handling data anomalies, including outliers, negative values, and zero trip distances.
- Descriptive Analysis: Exploring the relationship between trip distance, fare amounts, payment types, and other variables.
- Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns in the data, such as trips with zero distance or unexpected payment distributions.
- Revenue Insights: Analyzing the impact of payment methods and surcharges on revenue.

## Objectives
- Enhance Card Payment Systems: Improve the efficiency and user-friendliness of card payment options in all vehicles.
- Optimize Fare Structure: Review and adjust fare structures based on minimal impact factors, ensuring fairness and transparency.
- Driver Training: Educate drivers on customer service and the benefits of encouraging card payments.
- Customer Incentives: Implement programs to promote the use of card payments.
